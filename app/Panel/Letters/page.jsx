            Was seeing some reels and randomly thought about you
            Its so weird that there are just some days when life would feel so hard, that just being myself is too hard , it feels that everything is falling apart that no one actually likes me yk
            But then there is a voice that comes from within the heart that nah she is there, no matter what she loves you, that I am as important to her as she is to me.
            You make living easy and I don’t even know how but you do, jb koi nhi hota na sunnay wala tb ye zaroor pata hota hai k koi nhi Emaan hai us ko bataoongi to wo zaroor samjh jayegi , her waqt , her cheez main shayad kabhi koi aesa moment aya hi nhi jb maine tumharay baray main na socha ho.
<br/><br/>
            Kitna sukoon hai na ye soch ker k hum to hamesha saath rahay ek doosray k? And I don’t think it would ever be possible without you putting in the efforts too, I hope you know that you are someone really important to someone too. I know you  are going through a lot of family issues but I hope you know k I will be there for you too just as you are for me

            Ek reel dekhi thi where it said “what ạ privilege to have her” and really what a privilege to have you cause people really die to have someone like you
            lekin meray pass to ap k jesa piece hai huhu, a piece who is named Emaan jis ko acha nhi lagta when people write her name “iman?” (I think? Haina aesa hi hai na? BOLO AESA HI HAI???) , a piece who have the lamest lekin itna acha humor?? , someone who would also like to be as close to me as I want to be close to her, someone who would really understand everything you say to her( except when you justify depending on a man or when you say k nhi bs pasta main aur cheezain daal ker usko kachra banana nhi hai ) , someone who have the best fashion sense and would answer you foran when you need advice on k ye is kurti k saath acha lag raha ya nhi? , who also would do gareebi with you (cause what kind of best friends if not gareeb together (ameer bhi hongy inshallah)) , who have the best mindset, who knows how to fight for herself , who is not just the most strong but also she makes you realise that you are worth it too, who is the best daughter and the best sister( i hope they would realise it one day too) and ofc the best bestphrand?? So really what a privilege to have her, and I do never want to lose this privilege not now, not ever.
<br/><br/>
            I think everyone should have Emaan just not my Emaan ( ye bhi reel main tha yahan acha fit horaha)

            Today I was telling you everything that happened in the past few days and there you were listening like it really mattered to you, like knowing me actually mattered you know, how could it be that you listen even the smallest details? Like why would it matter to you anything about my friends life but it does, you listen when I am at my worst and you listen when all the doors get closed and then you listen even wo chotti chotti baatein k kesay sheeza se main tang agai hoon ya zahra ne kesay kia meray saath? Ye sab tumharay liye to kitni insignificant cheezain hain na lekin you actually listen k all of it matters to you too? K agar main zahra se chir gai hoon to you also feel it on the same level?
            How could it be that you make someone feel like they matter , I hope you know k you are the best at making someone feel at home, I hope you know k jo bhi tumharay ghar walay sochtay hain wesa nhi hai I have actually never seen someone who loves like this, without any conditions, without needing anything in return.
            I hope you know k you are just the best at everything, a girl with such a big heart who gives and gives, who wouldn’t turn her back to someone who is in need even if it is out of curtesy (thora sa change kerna hoga ye lekin)

            This time, randomly remembered you aj hum pics decide kerrahay thay and I realised that the way I trust your opinions  like I would actually do what you told me to do blindly, its kinda funny how much I trust your opinions in everything, her baat main ye sochna k is k baray main wo kia sochaygi, kia wo approve kareygi isko? Whether it be a small decision or the big ones (like choosing who I am going to marry???) how the hell that one small interaction in school where I just asked you if i could sit with you turned into this? Where I couldn’t even imagine my life without you? Kabhi agar future k baray main socho bhi to us main tum to constant hi hoti ho
            So this one is to say thank you for being such a good friend, thank you for being there, thank you for having such a good heart, you are the best thing to have ever happened to me!( haan haan Sab seee achiii cheez) You Actually tought me what being there for someone looks like or what loving someone unconditionally looks like.
            (Meri poori personality to banai hi apne hai)
            If I could turn back time I would still want to be your best friend and there is just another kind of comfort in knowing that you would too
<br/>
<br/>
            Ehehhe love youuu

            I liked this one new song and thought of you, and also since I am recommending you songs so I thought why not just come and write apki achi achi qualities( kia keroon buri to nhi likh sakti na bday wish hai lekinn main phir bhi likhoongi eheheh)

            These songs feel like they are for someone so close to you so here I am dedicating them to you, cause who would it be for if not you?

            Trust me when I say k whenever I hear something that is suppose to be for someone that is close to you, that knows you so well, all I can think of is you.

            It is so close to your birthday and I truly do want to do so much for you, I hope whatever I try to do, you like it (AND I HOPE I CAN ACTUALLY DO IT)
            Job ker k acha wala surprise dena hai ab ek din tumhay(adding everything to the pile of all the things we have to do after job) (KIA KIA KAREYINGY)
            (Trust me when i say i have a whole reels ki collection named as “emaan bday”) <br />

            And also I have this sudden urge to write everything i love about you so here we go ehehe
            School ne hamain kuch dia na diaa, lekin it did gave us eachother(yas did k saath second form jaan boojh ker lagai hai Bcz remember when we use to judge people just because they put second form of verb with did?? (Mujhy bhi did k saath second form hi sahi lagti hai aur pen ko larki pronouns se bulana hi (jo k ap baar baar sahi kerwati thi))
            Two mentally unstable women came together and became best friends?? Pichli dafa maine likha tha k I don’t know where i will be next year but I hope I still love you the same way and oh how lucky we are to say k ek aur saal ek doosray k liye wish likh rahay?
            I don’t think anyone ever best friended the way we did( atleast mujhy to ye hi sochna hai) kyun k dekho laiba matloob aur nashrah bhi ab bestfriends nhi rahay lekin we are and I absolutely love it
            (Except the fact k ab hamain arbasha k saath milna perta hai but every other thing is perfect and I wouldn’t change it for life)
            <br />
            <br/>
            No one could ever be you cause you are actually the bestest phrand someone could ever have, I truly love all the time we ever spent whether it be in school judging everyone, playing those games whenever there were oral exams and the term was ending and we had alot of free time, or whether it be discussing k Hamarey reference to context sahi huay bhi k nhi ( reference to context hamari dosti ka peak time tha ehehe) or the college jis ne hamain trauma denay k illawa kuch nhi dia but still saath to thay hum and that’s all that matters , I wish coaching achayyyyy se enjoy kia hota humne cause who knew that it would be the last time we will sit in the classroom together? I wish uni main bhi saath hotay cause imagine all the fun we would have had gossiping about the teachers on the teachers face but still ap k CA kernay se to bht behtar haii so its fine atleast there are chances that we could be at the same office. Time flew, we grew up, worked on our insecurities, built thora bht confidence, fought hamarey abbu jesay log and we did it all together!
            I hope we do get to be together in the rest of our lives too, I hope I get to call you my best phrand forverr {"<3"}
<br/>
<br/>
            Its 1:37am rn and we were just talking and my appreciation for you goes sky rocket whenever we talk and I don’t think someone would ever be more proud of me more than you cause how could you be happy that I stopped overthinking? I think i love you a little bit more whenever we talk

            Leaving it here.. kl we are meeting (arbasha k saath)
            (Nhi milay hum ehehe)
            <br/>
<br/>
            Also I hope you like the wish, I tried my best okay?? All of it geniuenly looked good in my head sahi hai?? lekin ab acha nhi lag raha huhu
            Nhi bhi kia to keh do achi haiiii ehehe ( at this point eheh hi hai mera her emotion ko describe kernay k liye hai kyun k emojis nhi use kersaktay aesthetic kharab horaha hai usse) mujhy website aur achi banani thi lekin aur time nhi thaa so this is what we have, just know I tried my bestt theek haiii huhu
<br/>
<br/>
And also there are actually many times where I remember you( like all the time hi) ye to bs jb hai jb maine phone utha ker accctually main apko appreciate kerdia 
<br/>
<br/>
            I LOB U BHT SAARA  HII
